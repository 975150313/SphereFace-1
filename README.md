SphereFace
===========================
This is a quick implementation for [Deep Hypersphere Embedding for Face Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.09298).This paper proposed the angular softmax loss that enables convolutional neural networks(CNNs) to learn angularly discriminative features. The main content I replicated contains: <br>

- **1**. comparison among original softmax, modified softmax and angular softmax
- **2**. 2D and 3D visualization of different loss on MNIST dataset
